##RaspberryPI Setup 

# Details of RPI I used :

ðŸ”µ Processor (CPU):

Broadcom BCM2837

64-bit Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A53

Clock speed: 1.2 GHz

ðŸ”µ Memory (RAM):

1 GB LPDDR2 (900 MHz)

ðŸ”µ Storage:

microSD card (16 GB used)

ðŸ”µ Operating System Support:

Raspbian (now called Raspberry Pi OS)

..> (I have used ZEBRONICS USB WEBCAM which supports 30fps)



# Python Version installed on RPi is 3.11.2

Major Libraries installed : Flask, paho-mqtt, RPi.GPIO, opencv-python

All Requirements are inside "pi_requirements.txt" in the project directory

1) Inside RPi create a folder (in our case its "rpiCamFeed" on Desktop)
2) Place or create the two files (mqtt_speed.py and rpi_stream.py) inside that folder
3) Create an Virtual Environment using command : python -m venv env_name
4) Activate your environment using command : source myenv/bin/activate
5) Once activated you can see (env_name) at the beginning of the command line

So basically there are two programs we need to run :

we do that it in separate terminals :
---> open two terminals
---> activate environments in both
---> Run one program in one terminal using command : python rpi_stream.py
---> Run other program in other terminal using command : python mqtt_speed.py


 note : AFTER RUNNING THESE TWO PROGRAMS YOU CAN RUN "RunMe.py" in windows PC
 

 For all the above steps for RPi : 
	--> Make sure RealVNC connection is established between your PC and RPI(robot car)
        --> For detailed information read the "RPI_Wireless_Access.txt" file
