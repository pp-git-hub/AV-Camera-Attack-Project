Why using RealVNC ? 

Since my Project involves a car and a track so we can't connect our RPI every time to HDMI to access RPI and do things like coding, debugging and all.


So we need to setup a wireless access to our RPI fitted to our vehicle robot.

For that we need to first plugin HDMI our booted rpi 3 so that we can see GUI screen.

. Now open terminal and type command : sudo raspi-config
. This will open raspi configuration setting page
. In the setting page , select interface options
. then select VNC option and enable it
. And now you are good to go
. Setup your wifi and connect rpi to a wireless hotspot network
. Note down your rpi's IP address (use command to see : hostname -I)
.This IP address will be used to connect from RealVNC in windows

# Now in windows :

.) Download and install RealVNC software for windows from its official website
.) Open it and search in address bar with this IP (you got from RPI) and hit enter
.) First time it will ask for login credentials (user name : usually pi and password your pi's password (while you booted your pi first time)
.) and hit connect
.) If successful you will see rpi's GUI on the RealVNC viewer
.) You can operate your RPI from here
