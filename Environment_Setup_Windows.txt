## This is all about you run your Program

=================== WINDOWS ==================

1) I have used Python 3.11.9

1) First Create a virtual Environment in Your Windows via CMD
   . Open CMD (location must be inside your project folder) 
   . Write following command to create virtual environment : python -m venv enviroment_name
   . For example : python -m venv myenv

2) Second Activate your newly created Environment
   . Suppose you created an environment with name "myenv"
   . Write the following command to activate your environment you created in step 1 : myenv\Scripts\activate
   . Once You enter the above command you can see (myenv) in the beginning of command line.
   . No you can install all dependencies and requirements in next step;

3) To install all Dependencies and Requirements , I have created a 'requirements.txt' file in the folder
   . Write following command : pip install requirements.txt
   . After sometime all necessary files will be downloaded and installed

4) Now to run your program (READ BELOW)
  . You need to run this file along with two programs running on Raspberry Pi (mounted on vehicle)
  . Before running, make sure 'rpi_stream.py' and 'mqtt_speed.py' on raspberry pi
  . As our main program "RunMe.py" will require a runtime video stream running on a server in a flask app that we created inside   Rpi (So we need to run them)
  . Ensuring both programs on RPi running.
  . Run your main Program "RunMe.py" on your windows PC , command : python RunMe.py
  . Now you can see your program  running showing camera feed from car
